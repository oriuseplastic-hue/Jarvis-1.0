# Contributing to Jarvis‑1.0

Thank you for considering contributing! 🎉 Every bit of help—whether it’s a bug fix, a new feature, documentation polish, or even a typo correction—makes the project better for everyone.

## Code of Conduct
We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). Be respectful and inclusive.

## Getting Started
1. **Fork** the repository.  
2. **Clone** your fork:  
   
```bash>```
```   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Jarvis-1.0.git
```   cd Jarvis-1.0
   

3. *Install* dependencies (adjust for your stack):


bash
   npm install   # or pip install -r requirements.txt, etc.
   

4. *Create* a branch for your work:


``bash>``
```   git checkout -b feature/your-feature```
   


## Development Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style (run `npm run lint` or equivalent).
- Write clear commit messages: `feat: add new option`, `fix: resolve crash on empty input`.
- Add tests where appropriate and keep them passing.

## Submitting a Pull Request
1. *Push* your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature`.
2. Open a PR on the original repo.
3. Fill out the template, linking any related issues (`Closes #12`).
4. Wait for CI checks to pass and a maintainer to review.

## What We Look For
- *Bug fixes* – include reproduction steps and a test that fails before the fix.
- *New features* – brief rationale, documentation, and tests.
- *Docs* – clearer wording, examples, or typo fixes.

## Questions?
Open an issue titled “Help needed” or drop a comment in the Discussions tab. We’re happy to help!

Happy coding! 🚀
